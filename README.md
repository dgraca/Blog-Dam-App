# A very simple blog
## Made in Kotlin for the class of Mobile Development (Android only)
This app consists in a very simple blog for the class of DAM - Desenvolvimento de Aplicações Móveis (Mobile Applications Development).
This app makes use of:
- Activities
- Fragments
- Shared Preferences
- Material 3
- Event Listeners
- Recycler View (pagination with endeless scrolling)
- Consuming API w/ Retrofit and Gson (Packages)
- Images w/ Glide (Package)
  - Displaying
  - Compression
- Logging w/ OkHttp (Package)
- Swiping to refresh the layout w/ swiperefreshlayout (Package)

The package used to deal with images is Glide, but it started with Picasso.


## The API was made using Laravel in [another repository](https://github.com/dgraca/project-DAM-backend).
The API was deployed in Azure using free student credits, thus being offline now.
